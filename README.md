# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
â€¢	The purpose of the World Weather Analysis Challenge was to create a data frame with the City Name, Country, Longitude, Latitude, Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed, and Weather Description for different cities around the world with the help of an Open Weather Map API. Using the data frame, we were able to create an input statement filter to help people identify potential travel destinations based on Temperature preference along with a hotel name in a close radius using Google Maps and Places API. After the user inputs the temperature criteria, potential destinations were given on a heat map which then allowed the user to pick four cities to visit and we created a travel route using the Google Maps Directions API.
